Command-line PRN calc implementation

Supports four operators now (+, -, *, /). Could be easily extended.

Reads input from System.in and writes output to System.out. Could easily reuse other input/output sources

To finish calculation, press 'q'+Enter or Ctrl+C .

To run a code, compile a project (assuming you know how to do it) and invoke following command from the output folder:
java com.svitla.calc.SimpleCalc

Time spent - 2.5 hours
